# 🍽️ FoodSnap Calories

AI-powered project for food recognition, portion weight estimation, and calorie calculation from photos.

---

## 🚀 Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation
- [x] Collect food images (homemade meals, canteen plates, restaurant dishes)
- [x] Build dataset with approximate weights & calories
- [x] Implement baseline calorie calculator

### 🔍 Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Image preprocessing & segmentation (detect plates, food regions)
- [ ] Ingredient recognition (CV models + food databases)
- [ ] Portion size estimation (heuristics + reference objects)
- [ ] Calorie calculation per dish

### 📊 Phase 3: User Features
- [ ] Web UI (upload photo → get report)
- [ ] Daily food diary with nutrition summaries
- [ ] Export reports (PDF/CSV/JSON)
- [ ] Mobile support (PWA or native app)

### 🤖 Phase 4: AI Improvements
- [ ] Fine-tune vision models for food categories
- [ ] Add depth/scale estimation for better portion accuracy
- [ ] Contextual calorie adjustment (fried/boiled/with sauce)

### 🌍 Phase 5: Ecosystem
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Integration with wearables (Fitbit, Garmin, Apple Health)
- [ ] Personalized nutrition advice
- [ ] Gamification (streaks, challenges, progress)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (planned)
- Python, PyTorch
- YOLO / Segment Anything for food detection
- Nutrition DB (USDA / OpenFoodFacts)
- FastAPI + Gradio for demo
- React/Tailwind for frontend
- Docker for deployment

---

## 📅 Timeline
- **Month 1–2** → Dataset & baseline model
- **Month 3–4** → Core features (detection + calories)
- **Month 5–6** → Web/mobile MVP
- **Month 7+** → AI improvements & integrations

---

## 📌 Goal
Make nutrition tracking effortless by just **snapping a photo** 📸 → get **calories, macros, and health insights** instantly.
